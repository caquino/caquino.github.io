Yesterday, 25th March 2015, I’ve presented in our first Dublin DevOps Meetup, that happened on Dublin Zendesk’s Office.

My talk was about my experience using Chef, what’ve learned over the years, my mistakes and how I solved some of my problems.

I would like to say thanks to everyone that came to Zendesk’s office to see our talks.

The presentation is available at [my github](https://github.com/caquino/talks).

Thanks!
