As you know, between September 7 and September 9 in Austin, Texas, the nginx.conf 2016 will happen!

It will be an awesome opportunity to learn from the NGINX experts and to join the community.

The good news about it is that NGINX kindly gave a gift to my blog readers, a discount code that will give you $400 off 2-Day and All Access pass!

Just go to the nginx.conf website and buy your ticket and use the code SYSHERO on the checkout, simpler than configuring NGINX right?

It’s almost 50% discount for the All Access Pass and more than 50% for 2-Day Conference Pass! 

Don’t miss this opportunity to improve your NGINX skills!
