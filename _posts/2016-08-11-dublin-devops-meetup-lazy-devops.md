Yesterday, 10th August 2016, I’ve presented in our Dublin DevOps Meetup, that happened on Dublin Zendesk’s Office.

My talk was about my experience building a PaaS, what’ve learned, my mistakes and how I solved some of my problems.

I would like to say thanks to everyone that came to Zendesk’s office to see our talks.

The presentation is available at my [github](https://github.com/caquino/talks)

Thanks!
